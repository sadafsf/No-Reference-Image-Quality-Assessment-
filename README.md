# No-Reference-Image-Quality-Assessment-

This project is, the non-reference (NR) objective methods are used to evaluate the quality of distorted images. In order to find the level of noise in the distorted image peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) is used and for assessing the contrast histogram spread (HS) metric is developed. Also, in this project, the quality of edges is assessed using weighted edge width (WEW). These metrics are chosen due to their low computational requirements and efficiency.
